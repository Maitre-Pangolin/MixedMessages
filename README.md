## About

First off-platform project of the codecademy pro career path **"Full Stack-Engineer"** , this comes after introduction to JS and Node basics and version control concept through Git and Github

### Project Requirement 
>For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.
### Implementation

Decided to implement a **random UserName generator**.

Each UserName is composed of an emoji, an adjective,a noun and a random number, see some of my favorite output below :
>🙎  EmbarrassedBratwurst_33 <br>
😭  GiftedBunghole_25 <br>
😦  ExuberantRage_86<br>
🙁  ItchyRevival_74<br>
😃  FilthyAuditorium_66<br>
😶  BusyGauntlet_97<br>
😳  JealousMess_29

It would also make for a great heavy metal band name generator !

I took this project as an opportunity to learn about node **filesystem module** using the synchronous version of readFile to retrieve the adjective and noun .txt lists *(public domain feel free to use them)*. 

## Tech
Basic project only using **Node.js** *(v14.15.4)*
